Object tracking is one of the foremost assignments in computer vision that has numerous commonsense applications such as traffic monitoring, robotics, autonomous vehicle tracking, and so on. Algorithms for this task have been developed for decades from traditional methods like Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi, Mean-shift, CAM-shift to current Deep Learning based method like ROLO,  DeepSORT. In this project, we will first have a gentle introduction to Object Tracking (Single Object Tracking specifically) and its performance evaluation metrics, then deep dive into Mean-shift and CAM-shift in the later sections. The classic algorithms of Mean-shift and CAM-shift will not only putted in place and re-implemented from scratch, but also its variants including the combination of Mean-shift with Hough Transform or Scale-Invariant Feature Transform aka SIFT. The problem of fixed window size of Mean-shift will also be discussed. Finally, every considered Object Tracking algorithms in this project will be evaluated in Visual Object Tracking 14 (VOT-14) dataset to better see the improvements through the progress.
